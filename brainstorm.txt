There will be 3 python modules:
    1 responsible for creating and reading from daily task files
    1 for inserting code into i3status
    1 for adding new tasks to the master task file

Instead of merely measuring tasks by the amount of time you do them, you should be able to use any arbitrary measurement, like reps, minutes, lines, pushups, situps
You should be able to have multiple arbitrary goals, and have them increase / decrease based on how many times you've completed the task.
If a task is not completed, it should roll back by the same margin it increased last time, and stay there for the number of times you failed at the next step
